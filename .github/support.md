# Getting Support for Amuzil projects

Do you need help with one of Amuzil's projects? You've come to the right place!
This document will help you get the support you need.

First, identify the project you need help with.

Secondly, think about the nature of your problem.
Are you having trouble installing the project?
Is the project not working as expected?
Is the project not working at all?
Is there a missing feature?

Then, navigate to the project's repository on GitHub.
If you're not sure where to find it,
you can find a list of all repositories [here][amuzil-projects-url].

Once you've found the project's repository,
your type of problem will determine how you should proceed.

## Installation problems

If you're having trouble installing the project,
look for a `readme.md` file at the root of the repository.
This file will contain instructions on how to install the project.

If you're still having trouble, see if there's a Discord server for the project.
It will be linked at the top of the `readme.md` file, right under the project's name.

If there's no Discord server, you can open an issue on the project's repository.
